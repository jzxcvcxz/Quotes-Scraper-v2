# Quotes Scraper v2
Welcome to **Quotes Scraper v2**. This is a web scraping tool that extracts quotes from the **Quotes to Scrape** website (https://quotes.toscrape.com/). Using Python and Selenium, with a single command, this scraper will log in to the website, gather information (author, quote, the link to the author's individual about page, and tags) of the top 20 quotes, and save them in a structured JSON format.

Here is the sample output for Quotes Scraper v2:
```
[
  {
    "author": "Albert Einstein",
    "quote": "The world as we have created it is a process of our thinking. It cannot be changed without changing our thinking.",
    "author_link": "https://quotes.toscrape.com/author/Albert-Einstein",
    "tags": [
      "change",
      "deep-thoughts",
      "thinking",
      "world"
    ]
  },
  {
    "author": "J.K. Rowling",
    "quote": "It is our choices, Harry, that show what we truly are, far more than our abilities.",
    "author_link": "https://quotes.toscrape.com/author/J-K-Rowling",
    "tags": [
      "abilities",
      "choices"
    ]
  },
